        <p>The Oswego Starch Factory became the largest starch factory of its kind in the world. The factory had its own fire department, which was established in 1857. The Kingsford Fire Pump wagon was hand-drawn and used a soda and acid combination to extinguish fires.The Kingsford fire pump wagon was first patented in 1867 and built in 1869 at the Kingsford Foundry & Machine Works in Oswego. Known as the "Little Giant," the fire wagon is a part of the historical society collections and has been placed on long-term loan to the firefighters museum.

        <p> The Utica Saturday Globe Feb 13, 1904, "The plant of the Oswego Starch Factory, controlled by the Corn Products Company, otherwise known as the starch trust, was burned Wednesday.  The fire started in the chemical room about 4 o'clock in the afternoon, and before anything could be done the building was a mass of flames.  Although the entire Fire Department was on the scene within a few minutes, no human power could have stopped the spread of the flames and building after building caught and went up in smoke.  The factory was running full-handed, and about 700 employees will be thrown out of work.
It was one of the most disastrous fires that has visited Oswego in many a day.  The property was valued at about $500,000, and occupied one of the best manufacturing sites in the northern part of the State, covering several acres." </p>
