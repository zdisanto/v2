	  		<h2 id="i">I. Earliest Recollections</h2>
	  		<p>They say I was born October 4, 1823, and from this date I reckon my years. It seemed to me a long time from one to twenty-one. As a boy I felt that I could never live to be twenty-one. Even now as I look back over my existence, it sometimes seems to me that I have lived forever. <br><br>
	  		The things that I remember as a child are very trivial, and I suppose they could not be otherwise. So far as I can re- call, the first thing that left an ineffaceable trace on my memory was the act of the servant, one Alzada Simons, who, taking me in her arms, held me over the well that I might look down and see the water below. The well was in front of the door, only a few steps away ; the water being drawn by an old-fashioned well-sweep. Another act of this servant also stays in my memory. She had been baking pumpkin pies and by some accident had upset one of them, to the serious disarrangement of it. This she gave to the boy Edward, who, taking it out of doors and sitting down under the pantry window, eagerly devoured it, leaving no part of either crust or filling. <br><br>
	  		I remember the little frame house in which we lived at that time, and many years subsequently. It had one common living-room which served as kitchen, dining-room, parlor, and, in time of sickness as hospital. Off from this was a small room occupied by father and mother as a sleeping-room, with a trundle-bed for the children, which was rolled under the parents' bed during the day and drawn out at night. The pantry was next to the bedroom and opened into the living-room. These three rooms occupied the first floor. The "chamber," as the upper floor was called, was a low half story all in one room, and was reached by a ladder. There stood the family loom with a bed at each end. By means of a blanket a partition was sometimes improvised in case of strict necessity. After a few years partitions were made and a staircase was built. Such was the house that my father erected for the reception of my mother in 1819. <br><br>
	  		In 181 5 my father took a farm one mile east of Perry Center. By the fall of 1818, he had succeeded in clearing ten acres of the solid forest of beech, oak, and maple, with a sprinkling of ash, white wood, and elm. He then returned on 'foot to New Marlboro (Mass.), taught school during the winter, and April 15, 1819, was married and started on his wedding tour toward the vast wilderness that had already begun to yield to the woodman's axe. This trip was made by the bridal pair in a canvas-covered lumber wagon, which contained all their personal and housekeeping goods. The journey, which led in part through forests and over corduroy roads, was accomplished in about ten days, including the Sabbath, during which they halted. The new couple were taken into the log cabin with an uncle until the new frame house, already described, was ready for occupancy. In a few weeks they were installed in the home that was the birth-place of their children. <br><br>
	  		The house was by no means completed at this time. It had no windows or doors, and no clap-boards. As for lath and plaster, they were quite out of the question. They never had a place in the new house. In the event of a driving storm, which actually did occur, continuing for three days, what little the house contained was piled up in the center of the living-room to protect it from the rain. Uncle Oren, coming in at the time, and finding them in this sad plight, took my mother home with him until the storm was over. Before the closing in of winter, the doors and windows were in and the house was clapboarded. They were now fairly settled and ready for further pioneer work. <br><br>
	  		My father had desired to be a doctor ; this his mother opposed, wishing him to be a shoemaker. To gratify her, he spent some time in learning the trade, but it being against his taste, he abandoned it. He learned enough, however, to be of service to him in repairing the shoes of the 'family. The harnesses, he always repaired. I well remember the old shoemaker's bench with its meager kit of tools which al- ways stood in the upper chamber. He also tried his hand at school teaching, as almost everybody did in those days ; but he was, by inheritance from a long line of ancestors, fitted to be a pioneer and a farmer. <br><br>
	  		The new farm contained at the outset a little over one hundred acres of solid wood. By slow degrees the forest melted before his axe, until the broad and fertile fields o'f waving grain gave evidence of a wonderful conquest. <br><br>
	  		The method of clearing the land was to fell the timber into piles and windrows, as far as possible, and, when a little dry, set fire to the fallen timber and burn all that would burn. What was left was drawn and piled up in large heaps called log heaps. The process was called logging. When in right condition for it, these log heaps were burned, and then the land was cleared and ready for a crop, which was sowed or planted among the stumps. The only product of the timber, aside from a certain quantity of charcoal manu- factured, was the ashes left on the ground. These were carefully gathered up and sold to the "asheries," where they were converted into potash. In the early history of the country, these asheries were scattered all over the country. <br><br>
	  		These were hard times for the early settlers, as is the case in every new country. My Uncle Horace used to tell the story of going five miles to exchange wheat for nails, a bushel of wheat for every pound of nails. Money was very scarce. Barter was the usual mode of exchange. <br><br>
	  		As for clothing, this was largely manufactured and made up by the industrious housewife. Nearly every house had its wheels for spinning and looms for weaving both linen and wool. Our mothers did wonderful things with these primitive aids o'f industry. With the linen wheel, which now stands in our parlor, honorably resting from its labors, linen thread was spun. With the hand loom, which always stood in the chamber, this thread was woven into cloth for towels, bed furnishing, and summer clothes for the children. Some of the garments thus made were a part of my outfit for college. <br><br>
	  		We children were always interested in seeing these occupations go on. The preparation of the flax for the wheel was quite as interesting as the spinning and weaving. The flax for this purpose was pulled up by the roots by hand, and laid in thin layers in swaths to dry. When thoroughly dry it was bound in bundles and packed away under the ridgepole of the barn on a scaflfolding of rails, where it would keep perfectly dry. It was the business of the boy to do the stowing away. <br><br>
	  		The time of highest delight was in the early spring, when the "brake" and hetchel were brought out, the bundles of flax thrown down, unbound, and in small handfuls put under the heavy "brake." This was a wooden instrument about four to six feet long, consisting of two parts attached at the end by a pin which allowed the upper part to move freely on the lower. The lower part stood on legs that raised it three or 'four feet from the ground, and consisted of five or six narrow strips of hard wood, probably maple, tapering to a narrow edge on their upper side. The upper part was similarly constructed and, when brought down, the long knife-Uke strips just fitted into the openings between the strips on the lower part. The upper jaw of the machine being raised, the handful of flax was placed in the lower jaw, and then the upper was made to fall heavily on the flax, to break the woody fibre, called "shives." This operation was repeated until all the wood in the flax was thoroughly broken up. The fibres were then placed over the top of a board about four feet high and ten to twelve inches wide, finished up to a somewhat sharp edge; this instrument was the "swingle board." The "swingle knife," made of wood in the shape of a two-edged sword or blade, was three or four inches wide and as many feet in length. With the broken flax placed over the top o'f the swingle board, the workman proceeded to work out the woody fibre by striking it with the swingle knife. <br><br>
	  		The flax being thus freed of its shives, was subjected to the hatchel (commonly called "hetchel"). This instrument consisted of a large number of sharp spikes fastened through an end of a board two or three feet long and five to six inches wide. The flax being drawn through these teeth was freed of its coarser parts, called tow. Being subjected to two or three of these hatchels, of different grades, it became fit for the spinning wheel. The finer products of the hatchel were worked into a coarse tow cloth, and the dressed flax into cloth of a fine texture. <br><br>
	  		From the spindle of the wheel the yarn was reeled off onto spools ready for the loom. Little use was made of the coarsest tow that came from the first hatcheling, except for packing and chinking. The finer portions were converted into a 'coarse cloth for bags, towels, and children's clothing. Such were the processes by which the flax was made to serve the needs of the household. <br><br>
	  		The manufacture of woolen garments was a larger and more important element of household economy. There, too, was much that interested the boys and gave occupation to the girls. First came the sheep washing, which was to the boys one of the most important days in the whole year. <br><br>
	  		Usually two or three farmers would join flocks as a matter of greater economy in operating. Each person was fitted out with a bundle of old clothes to be worn while handling the sheep in the water. The presence of the boy was most essential on this occasion to drive and hurdle the sheep. <br><br>
	  		The place selected for the washing must be well provided with water, preferably where there was a flume, so that the water could be allowed to flow freely, and so facilitate the cleansing of the wool. The flock was first driven into an enclosure adjoining the water. The boy was allowed to join in the catching of the sheep and bringing them to the water's edge for the men, who were in the water to their waists, engaged in washing them. When the last sheep had thus been washed and set free, all started for home. <br><br>
	  		Sheep shearing was next in order. This, too, was one of the great days for the boy on the farm. He was always present to help catch the sheep for the shearers. And then the lambs must have their tails cut off and their ears marked; and the handling of the lambs was the peculiar prerogative of the boy, who never failed to be on hand and to be very active on such occasions. <br><br>
	  		The fleeces taken from the sheep were rolled up and packed away for a favorable market, or sent to the mills to be carded into rolls ready for the spinster. This carding was sometimes done at home with small hand cards. The spinning was done on a wheel with a large rim, which the spinster turned with the right hand, as with the left, she held the rolls, and stepping back drew out the yarn, which she returned to the spindle by retracing her steps in a for- ward direction. Thus back and forth, backward and for- ward, she would tread day after day, filling spindle after spindle, being repeatedly relieved by drawing off the thread onto the reel. From the reel it was wound on spools ready for the loom. <br><br>
	  		The weaving of the thread into cloth was a slow process, and was done at odd moments snatched from the household duties. So it would be a long time before a piece of cloth would be completed, and then taking it 'from the loom was an act of no small importance. It was the end of a long and tedious piece of work. The spinning was often done by young women brought into the house and paid by the day. The weaving, however, was usually done by the mother, and it was not common for the daughter or young people to learn to do this work, so that it will soon be a lost art if it is not already so. The sponging and cutting into garments was usually left with the tailor, although the garments for the younger children were cut, sometimes, by the mother. <br><br> 
	  		That such mothers were very capable women, goes without saying. Such a woman was my mother. Although never a well woman, she was diligent, patient, and persevering, and accomplished a great deal in the course of the year. She lived not for herself alone, but did many deeds of mercy and charity. She looked after the sick and needy of the neighborhood. She might often be seen with her bundle of medicinal herbs, of which she always kept an abundant supply, going to prescribe for some sick child or neighbor. She was an admirable nurse, and knew how to employ many simple remedies for common diseases, and particularly those of children. To the church and many of the religious benevolences of the day she gave much time and aid. Her Bible class of adults she held until she was ninety years old. Her mental faculties remained unim- paired until the day of her death at about ninety-six years of age.

	    	<h2 id="ii">II. The Pioneer Farm Boy's Occupations and Interests</h2>
	    	<p>Among other occupations of the house in which my mother engaged, and which always interested us children, was candle-making. Very little was bought that could be made in the house, and her candles were the principal dependence for light in the house and barn. They were made of diflferent sizes and lengths for the various uses to which they were to be put. The wicks for the house were mostly made of cotton wicking, which was bought by the pound and arranged in suitable lengths and bulk for the kinds of candles to be made. The wicks for the barn lantern were, however, made from tow spun into thread and prepared for the purpose. The tow wicking did not give so good a light as the cotton, but lasted longer, and was thus more economical. <br><br>
	    	We got along with less light in those days than would satisfy the households of to-day. No candle was allowed to burn when not in use and several people together were accomodated with a single light. The wicks, arranged nine on a rod, the rods with each end on a pole arranged for the purpose were placed side by side at sufficient distance so that the candles would not touch each other as they grew under the hand of the manipulator. A vessel of hot tallow was placed conveniently near for the purpose, and the wicks on the rod were dipped in the tallow successively until all were dipped. By the time the last rod of wicks was dipped, the first row would be sufficiently cool to allow of another dipping, and so the process was repeated until the candles were of the desired size. <br><br>
	    	It was interesting to the boy to see these long rows of white candles hanging by their loops, and growing larger at each successive dipping. To avoid soiling the floor by any drops of tallow, boards were placed under the candles as they were being dipped. The proper consistency of the candles was a matter of no small importance. This was regulated by more or less beeswax being added to the tallow. The form of the candles was also thought of, and to be sure that they would remain straight and smooth the wicks were first dipped in pure melted tallow and then run through the hand and stretched out to their full length. This was a preparation for the regular dipping. When the dipping was completed, they were allowed to stand until perfectly cool, when they were sorted and packed away in boxes ready for use. The tallow used was the savings from the beef and mutton used during the year. <br><br>
	    	"Butchering" was another intensely interesting occasion. An occasional beef or sheep was killed, and as the neighbors did the same thing, exchanges were made, thus arranging a sufficient supply of fresh meat for all. In those days, in the country, there were no meat markets or meat peddlers. Much salt meat was used, particularly beef and pork, which was packed away in barrels and salted as the cattle or hogs were killed. <br><br>
	    	The kindling of the fire around the great potash kettle, the arranging of the temporary scaffolding with its inclined plane, up which the carcasses were to be drawn into position for being dipped into the boihng water to scald the skin so that the hair could be easily pulled or scraped off; the suspending th^em by the heels on the great cross-bar, the taking out of the entrails; the selecting of such portions as were considered suitable for use, notably the heart and those parts of the entrails adapted to making sausag€s ; the removing of the dressed carcasses to the cellar; the cutting up of the meat for packing; these were all operations that would naturally interest a boy, and especially if he were made to feel that his help was important, an inference he was very likely to make even if not stated to him in so many words. The pork was usually "cut up" and packed at night. <br><br>
	    	There were some other things that naturally grew out of "butchering day," that also appealed to the boy — notably the "stuffing of sausages." This was indeed a red-letter occasion for the whole household. So important was the occasion that it became the date from which we reckoned the time for arranging various important matters; notably the coming of the schoolmaster to board — for these were the days when the schoolmaster "boarded around." He was supposed to board with each patron of the school according to the number of the family represented in the school. We sometimes thought, however, that other conditions had something to do with the length of his stay in some families, and it would not be strange if they did; indeed, quite human that they should. But it was the generally expressed wish that he should not come until after the "stuffing of sausages." <br><br>
	    	With the children, sausage stuffing was an event lookedforward to and remembered with the greatest delight. When the delectable day came, all the chores and other affairs that required attention were disposed of at an early hour, and the whole family of little ones gathered around the central figures, father and mother, who had the work to perform. The sausage skins had been thoroughly cleansed by turning them inside out, scraping them, and rinsing in many waters, and were piled in a vessel by the side of the operators. The sausage meat, consisting of lean pork chopped fine, had been previously prepared with certain spices to suit the taste of the family, and placed in a vessel hard by. The sausage filler was constructed something like a squirt gun. It would hold perhaps two or three quarts, and when filled, the meat was forced out with the piston through the narrow stem which was inserted into one end of the delicate skin, the other end being securely 'fastened ; and with marvelous quickness, a thing in the eyes of the children wonderous to behold, a full-grown sausage, three to four feet long and an inch in diameter, lay curled up, serpent-like, before us. The sausages were hung up on poles for a few days to season, and then were packed away in jars and melted lard poured over them, filling all the interstices. Thus they were preserved for use as wanted. <br><br>
	    	The annual festivity that went on throughout the entire farming community at the "butchering" season deserves recognition. It must be remembered that fresh meat was not the ordinary diet of the farmers, and especially the fresh pork. The fresh beef and lamb, the veal, and the chicken came in occasionally, at different seasons of the year, but there was no meat so palatable to most of us as  some of the choice bits of the freshly killed pig. Such at least, appeared to be the general judgment of the people who indulged in this feast. Luckily the neighbors did not all butcher on the same day, but the time extended through several weeks including the latter part of November, and the early days of December, so that, by a system of ex- change, the fresh pork feast went on continuously well nigh to the end of the year. The joyful anticipations and glad remembrances of this prolonged feast still linger vividly in the memory after three score years and ten; and although it is long since I ceased to eat pork in any form, yet there is no kind of meat that I even now consider more toothsome than the tenderloin and the sausage as they came to my mother's table. Salt meat was the staple meat of the farm then and I suppose it may be even to this day. The men who work hard in the open air each day seem to thrive on it, but it could hardly be recommended to persons of less active employment. <br><br>
	    	The making of soap was, in a way, the outcome of the butchering season, although not immediately resulting. All the rinds from the pork, the bones, and every bit of grease and fat not consumed were scrupulously saved for the making of soft soap. The wood ashes from the stove were saved and put into the "leach," to which water was added and the resultant lye caught in a vessel at the bottom. This leach consisted of a hollow log cut from the forest and set on end. The lye was essential in the manufacture of the soap. The making of the soap gave a hard day to the housekeeper, and, although it was mostly out-of-door work, but few others on the farm had much to do with it. A barrel of soft soap was always placed in the cellar as the product. It was used for laundry work, and a dish of it always stood in the wash-room for use by the men in washing their hands as they came from their work.

	    	<h2 id="iii">III. Other Farm Industries</h2>
	    	<p>To THE royal occasions on the farm that helped greatly to give this kind of life a charm and left behind most pleasant memories, I must add a few others of no less importance to the boy. Among these, was the "taking up of the bees." In those days the bees were allowed to swarm naturally and were shaken from their temporary resting-place into rude hives, made fresh and clean and scented with "bee-balm" with the hope of making a welcome new home for them. Sometimes, however, they preferred a venture to the forests, and the din and noise of horns and tin pans was not sufficient to deter them from their purpose. I shall never forget the sweet lullabies of my mother as she sat by the newly-hived swarm, with the bees flying thick about her. Her voice seemed to have a charm for them that usually contented them to remain where they were. They seemed to have no thought of harming her. <br><br>
	    	When the old hives became quite full of honey the bees were destroyed, and the honey was taken from the hive. A shallow hole eight or ten inches deep was dug in the ground, of proper size to allow the hive just to cover it. Small sticks three or four inches long were prepared, sharpened at one end and split at the other, with a small swab of cloth saturated with melted brimstone inserted into the split ; and four or five of them were stuck into the ground at the bottom of the hole. These being lighted,, the doomed bees were set over the burning brimstone torches, and earth was packed tight around the bottom of the hive to prevent any ingress of fresh air or egress of live bees. All holes and cracks in the hive had been previously closed up. That the bees were soon all smothered is apparent. For a short time they were left to their fate, and then, if on striking the hive no answer came back, the decision followed that all were dead and the hives were taken to the house, turned bottom side up, and the process of extracting the honey went on as comb after comb was piled away in tin pans and on platters. In this way hundreds of pounds o'f honey were stored away for winter use. <br><br>
	    	My mother never hid anything from her boys, and the piles of honey were no exception. The children went to them when they wished and helped themselves with perfect freedom. At times they would take with them a friend to enjoy the sweet repast. I am glad my father kept bees and did it in the old-fashioned way, otherwise many a joyful occasion and sweet remembrance would have been taken out of my life. After more modern hives were substituted for the old hollow log, or the square box with stationary supports for the combs, and we began to draw honey out in boxes, our bee-keeping very soon came to an end. <br><br>
	    	The beginning o'f haying, too, had its season of anticipation. There was the repairing of the hand-rakes, the putting in of missing teeth, the replacing of broken or worn-out forms, snaths and scythes, repairs to hay-racks, the putting of bays and hay-sheds in order, ready to receive the new hay ; and lastly the grinding of the scythes as the final act of preparation. In those days we had no mowing machines, no hay-tedders, no horse-rakes, and no patent horse- forks — everything was done by hand. <br><br>
	    	In haying-time the boy had to turn the grindstone for the sharpening of the scythes. He was expected to follow the mowers and spread the grass that they left in the swaths, to facilitate the curing of the hay. If water was wanted it was his task to bring it. He also brought the luncheons in the middle of the forenoon. When required, he assisted in turning the hay to hasten the curing and in raking it into wind-rows for the pitchers; if it was to be cocked up, he raked up the scattered hay; he raked after the pitchers as the hay was loaded on the wagons ; and he was indispensable in mowing it away, especially under the low roof and in narrow places not easily accessible to the men. If nothing more important was required of him, he was set to treading down the hay, to make it as compact as possible. <br><br>
	    	The wheat harvest hardly waited for the completion of the haying. A man who in those days could, with his hand-cradle, cut two acres a day, was considered a smart man ; and the one who could follow him with the rake and bind what he cut, was regarded as a man of rare capability. In this way, two men would possibly cut and bind two acres a day. It was more common for the boy to rake the grain after the cradle, while a man 'followed to bind the sheaves. At the end of the day the sheaves were put in shocks of about twelve bundles. In this part of the work the boy was usually called upon to help. At their leisure hours the children were allowed to glean the scattering heads of grain, and after the threshing, were paid for the product in money. <br><br>
	    	After the haying and harvesting came the threshing of the grain. This was, indeed, a grand occasion. The threshers came with two teams and two men — one man to drive the horses that ran the machine, and one to tend the machine, feeding it with grain. The work of the boy was to get the sheaves from the mow, and to hand them unbound to the man who fed the machine. This required one boy to unbind and two or three, depending on the distance the • sheaves were from the machine, to get the sheaves to the boy that unbound. The unbinding meant the loosening of the knots at both ends, lest they should clog or injure the machine. This was lively work and allowed of no rest so long as the machine was running. At the tail of the machine stood a man who removed the straw, A second man took the straw from the first and landed it outside the threshing floor, A third man pitched it upon the stack, where were usually a man and boy to stack it. As the stack grew in height an additional pitcher was required. <br><br>
	    	Not all the grain was threshed in this way. Odd bits were beaten with the ancient flail. This was a slow process, but gave employment in the winter when there was not so much to do. Another equally primitive mode was sometimes employed. The threshing floor was filled with sheaves of grain, and a span of horses or a yoke of cattle was turned in and made to tread out the kernels by passing round and round on the sheaves; care being taken to allow them to change directions before they should become dizzy. The straw was occasionally turned until the grain was fully extracted. <br><br>
	    	The threshing, by whatever process, did not, by any means, end all of the hard work. The grain had yet to be winnowed and sent to the market or the mill. For this part of the work the boy was always called into requisition. He must, at least, turn the fanning-mill that freed the kernels from the chaff and foul seed. Ordinarily it had to pass through the mill twice before being properly cleaned for the market. This work was usually done on rainy days and at night when out-of-door work could not be attempted. Many a weary day and dark night have I devoted to the turning of a fanning-mill crank. I would turn with one hand until it was tired, then change to the other hand, and for variety would employ both hands. For a few turns this might be enjoyed by the boy, but long continued the aspect of the work changed. To swim in the wheat when stored in the ample bins suited his idea of fun much better. Nothing afforded a more acceptable play-ground than a bin of winnowed wheat. <br><br>
	    	When the wheat was put in bags and loaded into the wagon for the miller or the market, it was the boy's privilege to go along as companion. This often meant a ride of from fifteen or twenty miles in the round trip. The lunch was taken along, as also the bait for the horses, and partaken of at the place of marketing the wheat. This was usually York or Geneseo, places seven to ten miles away. All this was adapted to the capacity of the boy's enjoyment, and he relished it.

	    	<h2 id="iv">IV. Our Apple Orchard</h2>
	    	<p>When my father planted his apple orchard, his neighbors asked him if he ever expected to get any apples from it. He acknowledged that he had slight hopes of ever realizing very much fruit from it, but he thought his children might. In a short time, within two or three years, he had the pleasure of picking two apples. The next year he had a peck, and then stopped measuring. For fifty years or more he gathered abundant crops, and then they became at times a source of no mean revenue. The family was always abundantly supplied, and he had usually a handsome surplus for the market. <br><br>
	    	That orchard was one of the most delightful resorts of our childhood. Even in advanced life, after the old farm had gone into other hands, the remembrances were so vivid that it was not a little sad to my sister and me to see the old orchard cut down as no longer profitable to the farmer. In imagination our memories still cling to this favored spot. <br><br>
	    	But our cup of joy was complete, filled to overflowing, when the final apple harvest came. This was the time when the help of the boy was fully appreciated — a fact which added genuine dignity to his presence. He was everywhere ready to pick up, to sort, to carry, to pile, anything and everything that was in his capacity to do. He liked to handle apples, he liked to see the red and silver piles, he liked to see wagons loaded to their brims with the apples destined for the cider mill — everything connected with this business was a source of great delight to him. There was the unloading of the choice apples for winter use, and placing them by their sorts in the bins; the taking of the cider apples to the mill; the sips of sweet cider through straws, as it exuded from the press on its way to the vat below ; or the more hearty draughts from the cup provided for the purpose at the vat itself; the bringing home of the cider barrels and placing them in the cellar, destined for vinegar — all these were added phases of the prolonged joy. And then we are never tired of going to the cellar to view the apples in the bins, to take a sip of the sweet cider, and fill our pockets with the most luscious fruit the ample stores afforded ; a supply that rarely failed us until a new crop appeared. No restraint was ever put on the children. They always had all they cared for, and the boy was sure to take a generous treat for his schoolmates, which his numerous pockets furnished him the opportunity for doing. Then there was the drying of the apples for use when the stock of green apples in the early summer should run low, or for exchange at the grocery for such articles as were needed in the 'family. My father was an expert in paring apples with the knife, the only process known in the early childhood of the boy. Notwithstanding the expertness of my father at this business, it was a slow process at best, and it was hardly possible to prepare large quantities in this way. Later, when the paring machine and corer came into use, the case was diflferent. Then it was that the dried apples were sent to the market by the bushel. <br><br>
	    	It was the work of the boy to quarter the apples and string the quarters for drying. These strings were hung on poles in front of the great fireplace or in the open sun, according to the weather and the season. Sometimes the quarters were placed on boards in the sun without stringing, or were dried in the oven. This preparation of dried fruit gave occasion for the "apple-paring bee," which brought together boys and girls of the neighborhood for a jolly time. The boys usually pared the apples and cored them on machines, while the girls quartered, removing any re- maining bits of skin or cores, and attended to the stringing. Some work was accomplished at the "bees," but never to the exclusion of much 'fun and frolic. These "apple-paring bees" will remain in the memories of all the participants until memory fails to do its work. <br><br>
	    	I am grateful for the old orchard and all that it brought to me as a boy — joy, health, and good living; and above all, for the thoughtful father who planted it. It remained during his life-time a monument to his wisdom and fore- thought. I am glad he lived so long to enjoy it.

	    	<h2 id="v">V. My School Life</h2>
	    	<p>School life to me was one continuous holiday. To study was out of the question. I did not know what it was to study. I have no remembrance of having studied a moment in two years, unless it might be called studying to memorize lists of (to me) utterly meaningless words. If this doubtful process may be called studying, I did study my spelling lessons one winter when a prize of one dollar was offered to the one who should be at the head of the spelling class the most times. This prize was a temptation that I could not resist to engage in a most unpleasant occupation. To the mind of the boy, one dollar was a mine of wealth. He never possessed so much in all his life and he resolved to win it, cost what effort it might. He went in to win and was partially successful. It was equally divided between him and a girl in the school. There began and ended all his efforts at studying in the public school. <br><br>
	    	The boy literally hated study. With tears in his eyes, over and over again, he pleaded with his father to allow him to stay at home and work. The father's answer always was, "Edward, when you are older, you will always be sorry that you neglected your school." The answer of the heart, though not expressed in words, was, "I know better." I am not prepared to say that I have much feeling of regret for the loss of anything that possibly could be gotten out of those schools. I regard them as practically worthless. I really think it would have been better if my 'father had granted my request and kept me at home. I am inclined to the opinion that I got out of them all that was possible, and all that other boys did realize. The chief benefit one received came from contact. I often think that children get more of intellectual and spiritual growth from their plays and consequent contact than from their books and instruction. This part of my early training was abundant and efficient. <br><br>
	    	My schoolmates and associates were not, as a rule, bad or vicious. Like all boys and girls, they were fond of play, and in this we all indulged as freely as opportunity offered both in and out of school. For both, we had rare faculties. Not that these were purposely provided by the district or school officers but the environment was such that we were able to appropriate them to ourselves. We had no school grounds provided for play. I suppose that land at that time and in that locality might have been five or ten dollars an acre, and the trustees felt that they could not afford sufficient land 'for such a useless purpose as a play-ground. To avoid any expense of this kind, they placed the schoolhouse on the refuse of one of the asheries to which I have already referred. The boundaries of this old ash-heap determined the boundaries of the school lot provided by the district. <br><br> 
	    	In the schoolroom itself we entertained ourselves in discussing such rude pictures as we found in our spellers and readers and geographies. Thus we thumbed out the books, but never really studied them. If a picture interested us,
