# Personal Website V2 (2020)

Website states creation in 2018 but was updated from v1 to this version and I was probably too lazy to change the 2018 to Spring 2020 (some pages even say 2021...)

### Disclaimer
Not accessible for Mobile or Tablet.

I was also really into doodling the square pyramid featured in this version so I decided to create it digitally and present it front and center on the website.
