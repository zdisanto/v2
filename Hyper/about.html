  <h2>What We Are Doing</h2>
    <p>Information Science (ISC) 325 focuses on the design and authoring of multimedia and hypermedia. The World Wide Web is an example of a hypermedia system which is becoming dynamic. Multimedia and hypermedia link text, audio, graphics and video information in a non-linear fashion. Techniques to organize and access personal, course and business information, designing and developing hypermedia and multimedia applications will be explored.</p>
    <p>During the past weeks, our group was able to divide into subgroups. These groups were <i>Websites</i>, where Zo and Ray are working on the website portion of our project. <i>Phone Interviewers</i> where Matt and Orazio were able to get in contact with Paul Conzone the Fire Chief of the Oswego Fire Department and Brian Conzone, a firefighter and medic. Orazio got a phone interview with the Fire Chief and Matt has scheduled a phone interview next week with Brian Conzone. The phone <i>interview questions</i> were created by Michael and Ayinde, where they asked about the history of the first fire department, the average fire per year, fire fighting experience and any on campus fire they were present for. We are in the works of having the phone interview audio able to be listened to from our website. Our last group was <i>Information Sorters</i>, where John and Ben will be searching for viable data and information to be used in our website. Due to COVID-19, we were not able to physically visit the John D. Murray FireFighters Museum, but we were able to find photos and information of the exhibits through the Museumâ€™s facebook and some articles online. Moving forward, we plan to have this website up and running by next week, along with a timeline to be displayed on the website to have a visual representation of the important events that happened to the fire department. </p>
